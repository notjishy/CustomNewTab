# CustomNewTab
This is my own custom New Tab page extension for Chromium based web browsers.

Please note that it is very early in its development and is currently  missing a lot of features, enhancements, and design changes that will be coming in the future.

## Tested Browsers
This extension should work in any web browser that is forked from Google's Chromium project. The browsers I have tested and have confirmed the extension to function properly on listed below.

- Google Chrome
- Un-Googled Chromium
- Brave Browser
- Vivaldi*
- Microsoft Edge

\* When using the extension in the Vivaldi browser you need to enable "Controlled by Extension" under Settings > Tabs, in the "New Tab Page" section.

## Current Features
Listed below are the currently available features within the extension.
Again, note that this is still very early in development.

- Date & Time Clock
  - 24 and 12 hour time formats. Gets the time and date directly from your computer.

- Custom Wallpaper Backgrounds
  - You can save up to as many wallpapers as you would like, and easily switch between them. Unfortunately as of right now, to add a wallpaper you need to have a Web URL to the image, not an image file. I recommend using Imgur to upload your images, but any direct URL will work just fine.
  
## Installation
Since this extension is not available the Chrome Web Store, installing is a bit different than what you might be used to. However, it is still very simple.
  
**1. At the top of this page click the green "Code" button, then click "Download ZIP".**<br>

 **Congrats! You've installed the extension! Be sure not to delete or relocate the files you downloaded or you will need to add them to the browser again.**
